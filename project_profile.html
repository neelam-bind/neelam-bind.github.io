        <h2>Technical Stack & Flowchart</h2>
        <p>The technical stack involves a range of tools and technologies designed to analyze, forecast, and manage water resources effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection and Integration:</strong> Python, Web Scraping, MySQL</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> R, Numpy, Pandas</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning and AI:</strong> TensorFlow, Keras</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization and Reporting:</strong> Power BI, Matplotlib</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This stack supports the processing and analysis of water-related data to predict demand and optimize water management strategies. The flowchart (shown below) further details the process flow, outlining each stage from data collection to reporting.</p>

    <!-- Slide 3 -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
        <p><strong>Water Supply Mapping:</strong> The project identifies connections between dams and districts, analyzing their storage capacities and how they cater to different regions.</p>
        <p><strong>Water Usage Analysis:</strong> This step evaluates the water demands of various sectors, including agriculture, industry, domestic consumption, and ecological needs. Accurate data on these demands is critical for balancing resource distribution.</p>
        <p><strong>Water Demand & Sectoral Analysis:</strong> The team calculates water demand by sector, particularly focusing on irrigation and consumption patterns. This analysis ensures that water allocation is optimized for each sector.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Allocation & Management:</strong> Using AI models, the team simulates various scenarios to test different water management strategies. The results are visualized using Power BI to support informed decision-making.</p>

    <!-- Slide 4 -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Feasibility and Viability</h2>
        <p><strong>Analysis of Feasibility:</strong> The project is highly adaptable and can be applied across various sectors and needs. Historical data on dams and water usage is essential for accurate modeling, making this a critical factor for feasibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Potential Challenges and Risks:</strong> The team identifies two main challenges: adapting to evolving water usage patterns and integrating indigenous knowledge with modern predictive models.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategies for Overcoming Challenges:</strong> The team plans to use Geo-Ethnographic Data Fusion, which combines geographic and cultural data for better water resource management. They will also continuously update models with new data and insights to stay relevant.</p>

    <!-- Slide 5 -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Impact and Benefits</h2>
        <p><strong>Potential Impact on Target Audience:</strong> The project ensures equitable water distribution and helps prevent shortages. It also supports long-term water management planning and risk mitigation, benefiting both policymakers and communities.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of the Solution:</strong> In addition to practical benefits, the project emphasizes the preservation of cultural and environmental values. By integrating cultural practices with modern water management techniques, the solution promotes a holistic approach to sustainability.</p>
